# DNL343v2 Core Blueprint

Program Name: DNL343v2
Derived From: DNL343 (Denali Therapeutics)
Mechanistic Class: Selective ISR inhibitor
Rescue Architecture: SEI-validated blueprinting via Moleculogic

1. Therapeutic Hypothesis

A refined version of DNL343 aimed at modulating the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) in ALS, with enhanced glial support and optimized pharmacokinetics.

2. Key Innovations

- Low-Dose, Sustained-Release Formulation: Engineered to maintain consistent ISR inhibition while avoiding toxicity observed in continuous high exposure.
- Oscillatory Release Profile: Simulated kinetic waveform designed to pulse ISR suppression, reducing glial rebound toxicity.
- Glial NRF2 Permissive Coupling: Indirectly enables NRF2 antioxidant pathway in glia by resolving ISR-linked neuroinflammation.
- Adjunct Pairing with Edaravone: Rationalized combination therapy with a ROS scavenger to synergize ISR relief and oxidative protection.

3. Predicted Effects (via SEI Logic Simulation)

System | Expected Result
-------|------------------
Neurons | Enhanced ISR normalization (target index: 0.95â€“1.0)
Glia | Reduced stress rebound, improved NRF2 activation
CNS Microenvironment | Lowered inflammation, extended neuroprotection
Clinical Readout | Slower ALS progression, improved functional endpoints (ALSFRS-R)

4. Formulation Parameters

- Delivery Route: Oral
- Core Materials: Biodegradable polymer (PLGA-based) matrix
- Target Tmax: ~3 hours
- Oscillation Cycle: 12h sinusoidal release
- Co-administered Agent: Edaravone (IV/oral standard)

5. Validation Strategy

- Transcriptomic fingerprinting: NRF2 and ISR panels in glial cell models
- PK-PD linkage modeling: Quantify pulse amplitude vs. ISR index
- In vivo ALS model: Confirm survival and function under pulsatile dosing
- CMC Stability: Confirm reproducibility of oscillatory profile

6. Development Pathway

- Preclinical Phase (2025): PK, CMC, glial biomarker validation
- Type C FDA Meeting: Present reformulation rationale and ISR/glia hypotheses
- IND Submission (2026): If data supports safety, PK, and mechanistic rationale
